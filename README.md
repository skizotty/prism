# This an idea in which there is one single end point and everything is handled through form elements. 

Example would be there is a hidden form element that includes what the form is intended to do. 

The front end then sends the form to the endpoint, the enpoint then handles the request server side and returns the response properly. 

From the other side, forms are rendered using a json object containing the form information.
